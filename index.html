      <h1 style="color: blue; font-size:40px"> "switch vs if/else" </h1>

        <p style="font-size:35px"> The difference between "switch" and "if/else" could be said the speed of execution.
          The switch statement operates faster than if/else. The compiler creates a jump table during compilation.
          It jumps for value catching. If/else is a strict type of condition check.
          This allows for deciding which case has to executed, not which case needs to be satisfied.
          Switch statements are easier to read in comparison to if/else statements.
        </p>
        <p style="font-size:35px"> Limitations exist for switch statements as well. A switch statement must know the value during compilation.
          You cannot use like expressions or flat expressions. Variable expressions are not allowed either.
        </p>
        <p style="font-size:35px"> For complex comparisons or if there are large numbers to be compared, switch statements are good to use.
        </p>
        <p style="font-size:35px"> A if/else statement would be good for simple or small amount of compares.
        <p style="font-size:35px"> They are both used for evaluating conditions.
        </p>

        <h1 style="color: blue; font-size:40px"> "‘=’ vs ‘==’ vs ‘.equals’" </h1>

        <p style="font-size:35px"> Im java, the '=' would be used in a declaration of an int value such as "a = 10".
        </P>
        <p style="font-size:35px"> '==' is an operator that is used to check memory location or address of two objects are same or not.
        </P>
        <p style="font-size:35px"> '.equals()'is a method. The main purpose is to compare the state of two objects or contents of the object.
        </P>



        <h1 style="color: blue; font-size:40px"> "What happens when you include ‘import java.util.Scanner;’ in your code? Where does this functionality come from? What is the ‘java’ in ‘java.util.Scanner;’?" </h1>
